Project
 
Vision:
 
The
 
Convergence
 
of
 
Heritage
 
and
 
Ibadah
 
The
 
objective
 
of
 
this
 
report
 
is
 
to
 
architect
 
a
 
comprehensive
 
"Sankofa
 
Ramadan
 
Calendar"—a
 
productivity
 
system
 
that
 
transcends
 
the
 
traditional
 
static
 
timetable.
 
By
 
fusing
 
the
 
functional
 
requirements
 
of
 
a
 
modern
 
productivity
 
application
 
with
 
the
 
aesthetic
 
and
 
philosophical
 
depth
 
of
 
the
 
Akan
 
Sankofa
 
tradition,
 
we
 
aim
 
to
 
create
 
a
 
tool
 
that
 
is
 
both
 
a
 
tracker
 
of
 
time
 
and
 
a
 
cultivator
 
of
 
soul.
 
This
 
document
 
serves
 
as
 
the
 
master
 
blueprint
 
for
 
the
 
2026
 
Ramadan
 
season
 
(Hijri
 
1447),
 
specifically
 
calibrated
 
for
 
the
 
astronomical
 
and
 
geographical
 
context
 
of
 
the
 
Atlanta/Forest
 
Park,
 
Georgia
 
region.

The
 
user
 
requirement
 
explicitly
 
calls
 
for
 
a
 
"productive
 
app"
 
experience
 
rendered
 
in
 
a
 
document
 
format.
 
This
 
necessitates
 
a
 
shift
 
from
 
passive
 
information
 
display
 
to
 
active
 
engagement.
 
The
 
calendar
 
must
 
not
 
merely
 
list
 
prayer
 
times;
 
it
 
must
 
provide
 
"at-the-fingertips"
 
utility—daily
 
verses,
 
actionable
 
duas,
 
habit
 
trackers,
 
and
 
reflective
 
prompts—packaged
 
in
 
a
 
visual
 
language
 
that
 
honors
 
the
 
Sankofa
 
principle.
 
1.2
 
The
 
Sankofa
 
Philosophy
 
in
 
a
 
Ramadan
 
Context
 
The
 
central
 
motif
 
of
 
this
 
project
 
is
 
Sankofa
,
 
a
 
symbol
 
from
 
the
 
Akan
 
people
 
of
 
Ghana.
 
Represented
 
by
 
a
 
bird
 
with
 
its
 
feet
 
planted
 
forward
 
and
 
its
 
head
 
turned
 
backward
 
to
 
retrieve
 
an
 
egg,
 
or
 
a
 
stylized
 
heart
 
shape,
 
it
 
embodies
 
the
 
proverb
 
Se
 
wo
 
were
 
fi
 
na
 
wosankofa
 
a
 
yenkyi
:
 
"It
 
is
 
not
 
wrong
 
to
 
go
 
back
 
for
 
that
 
which
 
you
 
have
 
forgotten".
3
 
In
 
the
 
context
 
of
 
Ramadan,
 
this
 
philosophy
 
finds
 
a
 
profound
 
resonance
 
with
 
the
 
Islamic
 
concept
 
of
 
Tawbah
 
(repentance)
 
and
 
Fitrah
 
(the
 
primordial
 
nature).
 
Ramadan
 
is
 
not
 
merely
 
a
 
month
 
of
 
deprivation
 
but
 
a
 
month
 
of
 
return—returning
 
to
 
the
 
Quran,
 
returning
 
to
 
discipline,
 
and
 
retrieving
 
the
 
spiritual
 
clarity
 
that
 
the
 
distractions
 
of
 
the
 
year
 
have
 
eroded.
 
The
 
Sankofa
 
bird’s
 
posture—moving
 
forward
 
while
 
looking
 
back—perfectly
 
illustrates
 
the
 
believer's
 
state
 
during
 
Ramadan:
 
progressing
 
through
 
the
 
days
 
of
 
fasting
 
while
 
constantly
 
engaging
 
in
 
Muhasaba
 
(self-reflection)
 
and
 
retrieving
 
lessons
 
from
 
the
 
past
 
to
 
secure
 
a
 
righteous
 
future.

is
 
grounded
 
in
 
precise
 
astronomical
 
data.

The

must
 
account
 
for
 
the
 
lengthening

crucially,
 
the
 
Daylight

The

System:
 
Adinkra
 
UX
 
To
 
replicate
 
the
 
feel
 
of
 
a
 
"productive

the
 
document
 
employs
 
a
 
rigorous
 
Visual
 
Identity
 
System
 
(VIS)
 
where
 
every
 
graphical
 
element
 
serves
 
a
 
functional
 
purpose.
 
We
 
replace
 
standard
 
UI
 
icons
 
with
 
Adinkra
 
symbols,
 
imbuing
 
the
 
interface
 
with
 
layers
 
of
 
cultural
 
meaning.
 
2.1
 
Symbology

The

serve
 
as
 
the
 
primary

icons
 
throughout

The

The
 
"Bono-Gold"
 
Color
 
Palette
 
The
 
color
 
scheme
 
departs
 
from
 
the
 
typical
 
"Islamic
 
Green"
 
to
 
embrace
 
an
 
aesthetic
 
rooted
 
in
 
Ghanaian
 
heritage,
 
specifically
 
the
 
gold-weights
 
of
 
the
 
Akan
 
and
 
the
 
earthy
 
tones
 
of
 
the
 
Sahel.
 
This
 
palette
 
is
 
designed
 
for
 
high
 
contrast
 
and
 
readability,
 
essential
 
for
 
a
 
"glance-able"
 
productivity
 
tool.

Sankofa
 
Gold
 
(#D4AF37)
:
 
Used
 
for
 
primary
 
calls-to-action
 
(CTAs),
 
prayer
 
times,
 
and
 
the
 
"current
 
day"
 
highlighter.
 
It
 
represents
 
spiritual
 
wealth
 
and
 
the
 
light
 
of
 
guidance
 
(
Nur
).
 
●
 
Midnight
 
Charcoal
 
(#050506)
:
 
The
 
primary
 
background
 
for
 
header
 
cards
 
and
 
the
 
"Night
 
Mode"
 
sections
 
(Maghrib/Isha).
 
It
 
represents
 
the
 
depth
 
of
 
the
 
night
 
and
 
the
 
mystery
 
of
 
the
 
Unseen
 
(
Ghaib
).

●
 
Ashanti
 
Clay
 
(#964B00)
:
 
Used
 
for
 
borders,
 
progress
 
bars,
 
and

grids.
 
It
 
grounds
 
the
 
design,
 
reminding
 
the
 
user
 
of
 
their
 
creation
 
from
 
clay
 
and
 
their
 
connection
 
to
 
the
 
earth.

:
 
Used

It
 
provides
 
a

contrast
 
to
 
the
 
warm
 
earth
 
tones.

Limestone
 
White
 
(#EFF1F2)
:
 
The

To

must

(e.g.,

Its

The
 
Month
 
of
 
Mercy
 
(
Rahmah
):
 
Days
 
1-10
 
The
 
first
 
third
 
of
 
Ramadan
 
is
 
dedicated
 
to
 
seeking
 
Allah’s
 
Mercy
 
(
Rahmah
).
 
The
 
Sankofa
 
theme
 
for
 
this
 
decan
 
is
 
"Retrieving
 
the
 
Foundation."
 
Just
 
as
 
the
 
bird
 
looks
 
back
 
to
 
its
 
tail,
 
the
 
believer
 
looks
 
back
 
to
 
the
 
foundations
 
of
 
their
 
faith—Intention
 
(
Niyyah
),
 
Discipline,
 
and
 
Gratitude.

The
 
Sankofa
 
bird
 
turns
 
its
 
head;
 
the
 
believer
 
turns
 
their
 
heart.
 
Today
 
is
 
about
 
setting
 
the
 
"Grand
 
Intention"
 
for
 
the
 
entire

just
 
to

to

Conclusion
 
This
 
Sankofa
 
Ramadan
 
Calendar
 
is
 
a
 
fusion
 
of
 
two
 
powerful
 
traditions.
 
By
 
placing
 
the
 
Sankofa
 
bird
 
alongside
 
the
 
Hilal
 
(Crescent
 
Moon),
 
we
 
create
 
a
 
framework
 
where
 
the
 
user
 
is
 
constantly
 
reminded
 
that
 
their
 
spiritual
 
progress
 
forward
 
depends
 
on
 
their
 
willingness
 
to
 
retrieve
 
the
 
discipline,
 
heritage,
 
and
 
"sound
 
heart"
 
of
 
the
 
past.
 
The
 
2026
 
timing,
 
with
 
its
 
Daylight
 
Saving
 
shift,
 
offers
 
a
 
unique
 
challenge
 
of
 
adaptation—a
 
challenge
 
this
 
system
 
is
 
designed
 
to
 
meet
 
with
 
the
 
resilience
 
of
 
the
 
Aya
 
fern
 
and
 
the
 
wisdom
 
of
 
the
 
Sankofa
 
bird.
